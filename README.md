# My Matura Project: LocationHunter
### 2018-2019

This project was realized for my maturity diploma at College de Candolle (Geneva, Switzerland).
This github is only an archive containing the code, but the database structure is missing.

The project was developed in french and has not been translated to english.

It received the prize for the best IT project at the Collège de Genève and as a result it is now proprietary of the Collège de Genève [(more details here \[in French\])](https://edu.ge.ch/enseignement/sites/default/files/res-pedagogique-public/2021-11/informatique-2021-2022.pdf)

This project has been created during High School and is only a working prototype.
Indeed, there are many security flaws and does not follow many programmation concepts that I learned since then.
